# BERN02_Project_Credit_Risk
Evaluate predictive models for credit risk classification, identifying whether a borrower is likely to default or not. Techniques: PCA, t-SNE, SMOTE, Random Forest, Neural Network


We aim to develop and evaluate predictive models for credit risk classification, identifying whether a borrower is likely to default or not. The work involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, and addressing class imbalance using SMOTE. I will apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE to reduce dimensionality and explore underlying data structure both linear and non-linear characteristics.

The main focus will be on comparing the performance of a Neural Network model with a machine learning algorithm Random Forest, analyzing which approach provides better accuracy and reliability in predicting default risk. The project will also investigate how unsupervised methods like PCA and t-SNE can enhance supervised learning performance.

Collaboration with Nicolai Dimkovski Gottschalk.
